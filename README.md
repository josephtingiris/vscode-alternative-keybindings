# VS Code AlterNative Keybindings

VS Code AlterNative Keybindings is an extension and developer tooling
that provide an opinionated keyboard grammar focused on speed running
the Workbench UI.  Among many intuitively placed keyboard actions, at its 
core it features alt+arrow and alt+hjkl directional navigation among
the VS Code Workbench UI components (editor groups, side bars, panel, and terminals).

This git repository contains the user-facing extension plus supporting scripts,
development notes, and examples for contributors and advanced users.
